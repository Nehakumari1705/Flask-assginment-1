    "#### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Ans- Flask is a web framework for building web applications using the Python programming language. It was created by Armin Ronacher and is based on the Werkzeug toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Flask is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with a focus on simplicity and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of using Flask for web development include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight: Flask is a \"micro\" framework, which means it's small and doesn't have many dependencies. This makes it easy to set up and use, and it's also faster than some larger frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexible: Flask is designed to be modular, which means you can use as much or as little of it as you need. This makes it easy to customize and adapt to your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive API, which makes it easy for developers who are new to web development or Python to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pythonic: Flask follows Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability, which makes it easy to write clean, maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extensible: Flask has a large and active community, which has developed many third-party extensions and plugins. This makes it easy to add new functionality to your application without having to write all the code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is a great choice for web developers who want a simple, flexible, and easy-to-use framework for building web applications using Python.\n",
